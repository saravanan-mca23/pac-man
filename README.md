This HTML and JavaScript code creates a webpage featuring a moving Pac-Man character within a container. Pac-Man alternates between open and closed mouth states as it moves horizontally. The animation continuously reverses direction when reaching screen boundaries, offering a basic back-and-forth motion. Pac-Man is displayed with a width and height of 100 pixels and positioned absolutely within the container.
